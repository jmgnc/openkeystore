The JSON library supports a clear text signature system called JCS:<br>

##Requirements
* Java SDK Version 6, 7 or 8
* Ant 1.8 or later
* The projects are being developed using Eclipse but there's no dependence on Eclipse.

Currently only the "library" and "resources" projects are suitable for download:
```
$ cd library
$ ant
$ ant testsks
$ ant testkeygen2
$ ant testjson
```
##Proof of Concept Implementation
There also is an Android proof-of-concept implementation which allows you to test provisioning
and then using provisioned keys for authentication:<br>
